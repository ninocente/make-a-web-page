    <h1> How the Web Works</h1>
  </div>
  The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML documents. Types of files that can be found on the web are plain text, HTML, Images, Videos and Music.
  <br> The major pieces of the web are your computer & browser, The Internet, HTTP, and servers.
  <br>
  <br>A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
  <br>
  <br>Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions for example: the computer might do this by making text like this: <b>the results are real</b>.

    <h1>HTML</h1></div>

   HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the main type of content and
    <br>HTML documents are the heart of the web. It is made up of text content, markup, and references to other documents. Content is what you see; Markup is what the content looks like; and there are references to other documents.
    <br>

    <h2>TAGS and ELEMENTS</h2> HTML markup is made up of tags like what is being used to <em>italicize </em>. There is an open tag and a closing tag; For example: <b> contents</b> = bold. An HTML tag is always contain within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (..p..)
    and a closing tag (../p..).
    <br>
    <br> Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the ..br.. tag). An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags. Span and div tags are normal elements used to contain their content. The difference
    is that Span is inline and div is block. You can attach styles to them to help with the display of your document
    <br>

    <br> An Attribute is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write ..a.. with the ../a.. closing tag
    <a> href="www.udacity.com" </a>
    <br>
    <br> CSS controls the "style" of a page. When programmers talk about the <b>DOM </b> they are talking about the tree-like structure of a page. The style is the basically the way that you want your web to look.

  <div>
    <h1> Creating a Structure Document with HTML</h1> </div>

  <em> Developer Tools</em> for HTML elements are either <b>inline </b>or <b> block</b>. Block elements form an invisible box around the content inside of them.

  <em> The tree-like structure of HTML</em> comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. The relationship is like a family tree. the structure shows up as a series of nested boxs inside a browser, showing boxes inside
  of boxes. The relationshiop between indented HTML and Boxes
  <br>
  <br>When you read an HTML document as <em> text</em>, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it 's corresponding box.
